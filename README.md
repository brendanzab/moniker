This crate automatically derives variable binding and alpha equivalence for
abstract syntax trees. This is really handy for eliminating error-prone
boilerplate code for name binding, and make it easier to implement new languages
in Rust.

## Example

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate moniker;

use moniker::{Scope, Embed, Name, Var};
use std::rc::Rc;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, BoundTerm)]
pub enum Type {
    Base,
    Arrow(Rc<Type>, Rc<Type>),
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, BoundTerm)]
pub enum Expr {
    Var(Var),
    Lam(Scope<(Name, Embed<Rc<Type>>), Rc<Expr>>),
    App(Rc<Expr>, Rc<Expr>),
}
```

Here are some interesting references that were helpful in understanding the
locally nameless representation that is used by this crate:

## Inspiration

The API was mainly inspired by the Unbound and Unbound-Generics libraries for
Haskell, with some differences. The main change that we make is to have two
separate traits (`BoundTerm` and `BoundPattern`) in place of Unbound's single
`Alpha` type class. We've found that this better captures the semantics of the
library, and greatly cuts down on the potential for accidental misuse.

Other auto-binding libraries exist for a number of different languages:

- DBLib: Facilities for working with de Bruijn indices in Coq
    - [Blog Post](http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/announcing-dblib/)
    - [Github](https://github.com/coq-contribs/dblib)
- Unbound: Specify the binding structure of your data type with an
  expressive set of type combinators, and Unbound handles the rest!
  Automatically derives alpha-equivalence, free variable calculation,
  capture-avoiding substitution, and more.

- Unbound-Generics: an independent re-implementation of Unbound but using
  GHC.Generics instead of RepLib.
